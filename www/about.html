				Great Food, For a Great Cause We set out with a couple
				very important factors in mind. Create an event that
				showcased the great culinary talent that Palm Beach
				County has to offer and raise awareness to local
				community causes. Everyone loves great food and there
				isn't anything better than enjoying great flavors while
				being among friends and family. Each year we have
				continued to grow and expand our guests' favorite
				experiences and this year will be no different. The 2016
				Feast of the Sea will be held October 22, 2016 starting
				at 11am inside the Meyer Amphitheater. What is slated to
				be one of the most memorable 1 day seafood and culinary
				extravaganzas to date, this year will involve 24 of the
				best Palm Beach County chefs representing their amazing
				respective restaurants and brands. During the FREE
				daytime feastivities guests enjoy great food and
				beverages, demonstrations, live music, and much more.
				One new addition is the Knife fights; hourly chef
				competitions where all the chefs will stop everything a
				compete in some friendly chef battles for cash. One
				knife battle is the ‘Slice and Dice’ where each chef
				will be given ingredients to slice and dice as fast as
				they can inches from guests faces for their chance at
				winning some beer money. The night time transitions into
				a private grand tasting; 4 hours of heated chefs
				competition. For the 3rd year; 16 of Palm Beach Counties
				best culinary marksmen will create sparks in front of an
				amphitheater full of people and projected on a large LED
				wall. 4 rounds will determine the last chef standing and
				be crowned 2016 Maestro del Mar. As well as, the proud
				new owner of an over-sized plastic check worth 5000
				dollars. This portion of the day is a private event and
				exclusive passes go on sale August 1st and will sell
				out. A portion of each pass sold goes to several of our
				local organizations including our main beneficiaries,
				Ernie Els - Els for Autism Foundation that will be
				starting a culinary program on campus and be open to all
				individuals on the spectrum. As well as, Future 6
				Helping Hand Fund; this local organization provides free
				action sports camps - Surfing, Skating, Fishing - for
				kids with special needs and at-risk youth. The synergy
				between the 2 organizations is really something we are
				excited about this year. We have a great beach party
				planned that includes all the kids from both sides. This
				will take place prior to this year's Feast of the Sea.
